# Provably fair shuffling: "mochapoker-v1"

Every deck at a Mocha Poker table is a uniform Fisher–Yates shuffle of the 52 cards whose randomness is fixed by two things:

* a secret **server seed**, committed to (by hash) *before* anyone could know the hand, and
* a **client seed** from each player, chosen in the player's browser *after* seeing that commitment.

The server cannot pick a convenient seed after seeing the players' seeds (the hash is already public), and no player can steer the result alone (the server seed is secret until the hand ends). After each hand the server reveals its seed, and anyone can recompute the deck. The "Verify fairness" button in Last hand and History does exactly that in your browser.

## Protocol

1. **Commitment.** A table always holds a secret `nextServerSeed` (32 random bytes) for the next hand. It publishes `serverSeedHash = hex(sha256(seedBytes))` (hash of the 32 decoded bytes, not of the hex text) in `TableView.fairness = { nextHandNumber, serverSeedHash }`. The first seed is created with the table; the next one is created right after a hand's deck is built, so the commitment for hand N+1 is visible during hand N.
2. **Client seeds.** When a client sees a commitment it has not answered yet, it generates 16 random bytes (`crypto.getRandomValues`), encodes them as 32 lowercase hex characters, and sends `seed { handNumber, clientSeed }`. It also stores `{ tableId, handNumber, serverSeedHash, clientSeed }` in `localStorage` (last 300) so it can later prove which commitment it saw before the deal. The server keeps one seed per player for `nextHandNumber` (a later one replaces an earlier one until the deal) and silently ignores anything else (wrong hand number, not `/^[0-9a-f]{32}$/`).
3. **Deal.** The seeds of the players dealt into the hand are used; players who sent none simply do not contribute (the table log says e.g. `Shuffle seeds: 4 of 5 players`).
   * `material = "mochapoker-v1|" + tableId + "|" + handNumber + "|" + pairs.join(",")` where `pairs` is every contributing `playerId + ":" + clientSeed`, sorted by `playerId` (plain string order, UTF-16 code units).
   * Random stream: for `i = 0, 1, 2, ...`, `block_i = HMAC-SHA256(key = serverSeedBytes, message = UTF-8(material + "|" + i))`. Each block is read as eight big-endian uint32 values, in order; blocks are consumed one after another.
   * `randInt(n)`: `limit = floor(2^32 / n) * n`; draw the next uint32 `u` until `u < limit`; return `u % n` (rejection sampling, no modulo bias).
   * `deck = freshDeck()` (clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades, each 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 T J Q K A; cards written like `Kc`, `Td`). Then for `i = 51` down to `1`: `j = randInt(i + 1)`; swap `deck[i]` and `deck[j]`. The first card dealt is `deck[0]`.
4. **5-Murder reshuffles.** When the draw pile runs out in the middle of a hand, the discard pile (in its current order) is shuffled with the same algorithm. The k-th reshuffle of the hand (k = 1, 2, ...) uses the message prefix `material + "|reshuffle" + k` in place of `material` (so block i uses `material + "|reshuffle" + k + "|" + i`), with the same server seed as key.
5. **Reveal.** When the hand completes, the hand record gains `fair = { algorithm: "mochapoker-v1", serverSeed, serverSeedHash, clientSeeds, material }` next to the existing `reveal.deck`. The legacy deck fingerprint (`deckHash = sha256(salt + ":" + deck.join(","))`) is still published during the hand and revealed afterwards.

## What to check

1. `sha256(hex-decoded serverSeed) == serverSeedHash`, and that hash equals the commitment you saw *before* the deal.
2. Your own seed appears in `clientSeeds` under your player id.
3. `material` rebuilt from `tableId`, `handNumber` and `clientSeeds` equals `fair.material`, and the deck derived from `serverSeed` and `material` equals `reveal.deck`.
4. The deck fingerprint matches.

```js
import { createHmac } from "node:crypto";
function derive(seedHex, material) {
  const key = Buffer.from(seedHex, "hex");
  let block = 0, words = [];
  const next = () => {
    if (!words.length) {
      const d = createHmac("sha256", key).update(material + "|" + block++).digest();
      for (let o = 0; o < 32; o += 4) words.push(d.readUInt32BE(o));
    }
    return words.shift();
  };
  const deck = [];
  for (const s of "cdhs") for (const r of "23456789TJQKA") deck.push(r + s);
  for (let i = 51; i >= 1; i--) {
    const n = i + 1, limit = Math.floor(2 ** 32 / n) * n;
    let u; do u = next(); while (u >= limit);
    const j = u % n;
    [deck[i], deck[j]] = [deck[j], deck[i]];

## Limits of the guarantee

* A player who never sends a seed gets no say in the shuffle, but the server still cannot change its committed seed, and the others' seeds still count. Checking that your own seed is included is what proves the server did not drop it.
* The server could in theory refuse to deal a hand it dislikes, but it cannot choose the cards.
* Table tests and tools can inject fixed decks; such hands carry no `fair` data and the table publishes no commitment.
